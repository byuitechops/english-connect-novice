              <p>My mother, father, and three sisters and I live in a small house in Central America. My father works on a farm.  My mother is a waitress in a restaurant.  I am the oldest. I take care of my sisters.</p><p>One day my father is killed by a drug gang.  It is terrible.  My mother wants to move to the United States.  She doesnâ€™t feel safe anymore.  She talks to my grandfather and grandmother.  They are worried.  They do not want her to go away.</p><p>My mother decides to go anyway. My mother asks my aunts and uncles to take care of my three sisters.  Mother will come back for them in a year or two. My mother and I start walking north.</p><p>We have many problems. Some people are kind to us. Others treat us badly.  After many months, we enter the United States as refugees.</p><p>In Texas, my mother meets a nice man.  He is divorced and has a son and a daughter.  They decide to get married.  I like my new step-father.  My step-sister and step-brother are kind to me.  I try to be kind also.  Some day soon, we hope that we will return to Central America. We want to bring my sisters to the United States.</p>
